This set of files is designed to be part of an installer package delivered
on a USB drive. The whole package fits easily on a 1GB drive. The files in this directory are coupled with a eucalyptus open source release, euca2ools and a centos guest image. The files needed are;
eucalyptus-2.0.3-centos-x86_64.tar.gz
euca2ools-1.3.1-centos-x86_64.tar.gz
euca-centos-5.5-x86_64-13Mar2011.tgz

The first two are availble at http://open.eucalyptus.com/downloads and the last isn't but can be substituted for another image bundle.

These scripts perform an install with some assumptions which simplify the process and provide a stable starting point. We assume you have a fresh CentOS 5.6 install, configured on a network with a static IP. The cloud will use MANAGED_NOVLAN mode. All Eucalyptus components will be on one machine excepting the node controller. There will be 1 or more separate node controllers that are configured as part of a cluster. Here are some hardware requirements;
 - 2 or more machines required
 - 2 or more cores per machine
 - 1 NIC per machine
 - common network switch
 - A set of free IP addresses (in the same subnet as the Eucalyptus machines) must be available for Eucalyptus to use.
 - A large subnet (Class B, or full Class C preferably) of private address range should be made available for Eucalyptus.
 - Eucalyptus maintains its own internal DHCP server, which issues IP addresses to Eucalyptus VMs.
 - There should be no other DHCP server in the system that would issue an IP address to the VMsâ€™ DHCP broadcast.
 - text console connection to all machines (though, not at same time)
